# Maze Challenge System

A complete maze generation and solving system with visualization capabilities, designed for educational purposes.

## Overview

This system consists of 4 main programs that work together to create, solve, analyze, and visualize maze challenges:

1. **üèóÔ∏è Maze Generator** (`maze_generator.py`) - Creates deterministic mazes with hardcoded keys
2. **ü§ñ Maze Solver** (`maze_solver_answer.py` + `maze_solver_template.py`) - Finds all possible paths through the maze
3. **üìä Path Analyzer** (`path_analyzer_answer.py` + `path_analyzer_template.py`) - Ranks and analyzes the best paths
4. **üé® Maze Visualizer** (`maze_visualizer.py` + `maze_gui.py`) - Creates visual representations of the maze and solutions

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Launch the GUI Visualizer (Recommended):**
   ```bash

   - Implement path generation algorithms
   - Learn about exhaustive search techniques
   - Practice CSV file handling

2. **Continue with** `path_analyzer_template.py`
   - Implement data analysis and ranking
   - Learn about multi-criteria decision making
   - Practice statistical calculations

3. **Test and visualize** your solutions
   - Use the GUI to see your paths interactively
   - Compare with answer key implementations
   - Iterate and improve your algorithms

### Assignment Workflow

```bash
# 1. Student implements template
python maze_solver_template.py     # (after implementing TODO methods)

# 2. Student implements analyzer
python path_analyzer_template.py   # (after implementing TODO methods)

# 3. Student visualizes results with GUI
python launch_gui.py

# 4. Compare with reference implementation
python maze_solver_answer.py
python path_analyzer_answer.py
```

## Generated Files

When you run the system, it creates:

- **`maze_results.csv`** - Complete solving results
- **`top_paths.csv`** - Top 10 ranked paths
- **`unsolved_maze.png`** - Maze structure visualization
- **`solved_maze.png`** - Maze with best paths highlighted
- **`path_comparison.png`** - Path comparison charts

## Maze Structure

The maze consists of decision points where you can choose directions:

- **Directions:** left, middle, right
- **Outcomes:** 
  - Continue to next position
  - Success (exit found) - earns points
  - Failure (dead end) - minimal points
- **Scoring:** Based on path efficiency and decision count

## Advanced Features

### Smart Path Generation
The solver uses intelligent path generation to reduce search space while ensuring completeness.

### Multi-Criteria Ranking
Paths are ranked using a composite score considering:
- Raw score (40%)
- Efficiency (30%)
- Path length (20%)
- Complexity (10%)

### Interactive GUI Visualization
The GUI system provides multiple interaction modes:
- Manual maze exploration with instant feedback
- Automated path animation with timing controls
- Real-time statistics and performance metrics
- Export capabilities for presentations and reports

## Usage Examples

### Quick GUI Launch
```bash
# Fastest way to start exploring
python launch_gui.py
```

### Complete Workflow
```bash
# 1. Generate maze and solve all paths
python maze_solver_answer.py

# 2. Launch GUI to explore results
python launch_gui.py

# 3. In GUI: Click "Load Best Paths" ‚Üí Select a path ‚Üí Click "Play"
```

### Educational Sequence
```bash
# 1. Show students the maze structure
python maze_generator.py

# 2. Let them implement the solver template
# (Students work on maze_solver_template.py)

# 3. Test their implementation
python maze_solver_template.py

# 4. Visualize their results
python launch_gui.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors:** Ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **No CSV file:** Run the solver before the analyzer or GUI
3. **GUI doesn't start:** Check that tkinter is available (comes with most Python installations)
4. **Visualization errors:** Check that matplotlib backend is properly configured
5. **Memory issues:** Reduce `max_depth` parameter in path generation

### Getting Help

```bash
python main_demo.py help     # Show usage information
python main_demo.py student  # Show student-specific guidance
python main_demo.py test     # Run system diagnostics
python launch_gui.py         # Direct GUI access
```

## Customization

### Changing the Maze
Modify the `seed_key` in `maze_generator.py` to create different mazes:

```python
maze = MazeGenerator(seed_key="YOUR_CUSTOM_KEY_HERE")
```

Or use the GUI's "Generate New Maze" button to create different mazes interactively.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- Modify `max_depth` in solver for longer/shorter path searches
- Adjust scoring weights in the analyzer
- Change maze size by modifying the range in `_generate_maze_structure()`

## GUI Keyboard Shortcuts

While using the GUI:
- **Enter** - Confirm dialogs
- **Escape** - Cancel operations
- **Space** - Reset to starting position
- **Arrow Keys** - Navigate in matplotlib view (when focused)
